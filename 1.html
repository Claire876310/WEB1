    <h2>HTML이란 무엇인가</h2>
    <p><a href="https://www.w3.org/TR/html52/"target="_blank"title="HTML5 specification">Hypertext Markup Language (HTML)</a> is the standard markup Language for <strong>creating <u>web</u> pages</strong> and web applications. HTML or Hypertext Markup Language (HyperText Markup Language, Culture: Hypertext Markup Language, Hypertext Markup Language) is the dominant markup language for web pages. HTML provides a way to create structural documents with links, quotes, and other items as well as represent architectural meanings for texts such as titles, paragraphs, lists, etc.</p><img src="coding.jpg"width="50%"><p style="margin-top:40px;">It can then be used to embed images and objects and generate interactive forms. HTML is written in the form of HTML elements, which are "tags" surrounded by angle brackets within web page content. HTML can include or recall JavaScripts that affect the behavior of HTML processing devices such as Web browsers, and scripts such as CSSs that define the appearance and placement of text and other items. The W3C, co-director of HTML and CSS standards, recommends the use of CSS for clear and tabular markups.</p>
